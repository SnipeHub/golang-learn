        // Welcome to my GO study guide // Created by SnipeHub

After much research and thought, I have decided it is in my best interest to learn GO also.
I am sure you will come to the same conclusion, unless for some specific reason otherwise.

Lets just say, GO is the future!

PS. Reminder to self to create a branch on github first. Not through github desktop. Causes headaches.
